Umurava is a Talent Marketplace Platform on a mission to build Africa’s largest workforce of digital talents and connect them with job opportunities in various companies and organizations locally in Africa and globally in America and Europe by addressing the global talent shortage in digital careers and the high rate of youth unemployment in Africa. In 3 years, we vetted and matched 1300+ Talents with jobs and projects in 400+ companies and organizations, with a target to match 5000+ Talents with employment in 2026. Powered by AI Technology and Talent Management Expertise, Umurava made talent hiring and outsourcing fast, simple, and cost-effective.
