### **Executive Summary**

**Itsinda Team** presents **E-Itsinda**, a digital management platform designed to modernize and secure Rwanda’s traditional community savings groups, commonly known as Itsinda or Ibimina. These groups are critical to financial resilience, especially for women, youth, low-income earners, and farmers. Despite their importance, most operate manually, relying on notebooks, verbal agreements, and non-standard calculations—practices that conflict with Rwanda’s new regulatory framework (Official Gazette N° 045 of 06/11/2023), which mandates formal registration, structured governance, and standardized financial reporting.

The lack of practical digital tools exposes members to miscalculations, fund misuse, data loss, and leadership overload. Women-led groups, in particular, face barriers due to limited access to technology, placing their financial security at risk and hampering national financial inclusion goals. While the government has developed registration portals and digital infrastructure, community operations remain largely disconnected from compliance systems.

**E-Itsinda** bridges this gap by providing a localized, simple, and trusted platform that digitizes daily operations, automates financial record-keeping, and ensures compliance with national regulations. Key features include:

- **Digitized Operations:** Track contributions, loans, interest, penalties, payouts, and group cycles in real time.
    
- **Compliance-Ready Reporting:** Automatically generate standardized books of accounts and digital reports compatible with government portals, reducing errors and governance risks.
    
- **Blockchain-Enabled Trust:** Integrate Cardano blockchain to create immutable ledgers and smart contracts for automated payouts, loan rules, and interest calculations, eliminating fraud and data tampering.
    
- **Inclusive Access:** USSD functionality ensures mothers, elders, and low-tech members can contribute, check balances, and request loans without smartphones.
    
- **Pilot Deployment:** Launch in Gahanga Sector to validate features, gather feedback, and refine the system before scaling nationwide.
    

By combining digital accessibility, blockchain security, and compliance-ready features, **E-Itsinda** empowers community saving groups to operate transparently, safely, and in line with national regulations—strengthening financial inclusion, trust, and economic resilience across Rwanda.
