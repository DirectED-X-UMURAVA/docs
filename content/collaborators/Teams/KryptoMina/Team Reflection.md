During this exploration, our team’s understanding of cooperatives and ibimina changed
significantly. At first, we assumed the main challenges were just slow loan processes and
outdated methods. However, as we spoke to cooperative owners, traders, farmers, and
neighbourhood members, we discovered that the issue is much deeper and more emotional.

What stood out most was the level of effort people put into earning money for contributions.
Many explained the sacrifices they make each week to save small amounts, hoping it will help
them grow financially. Yet they often face mismanagement, inaccurate records, and broken
promises. Hearing these stories made us realize that this challenge is not only financial — it is
deeply tied to trust, dignity, and the hope for a better future.

We were surprised by how common cases of fraud and disappearance of funds are, despite the
popularity of ibimina and cooperatives. Even more surprising was the resilience of individuals
who continue to rejoin new groups after being disappointed. This showed us how essential
savings groups are to people’s lives, even with their flaws.

As a team, we learned to listen more carefully, ask better questions, and observe the
environment without jumping to solutions too quickly. We saw that the community is not asking
for something complicated — they simply want fairness, clarity, and accountability. They want to
feel protected. They want their hard-earned money to be safe.
This stage grounded our project in real human needs. It helped us see that technology should
not replace community structures but strengthen them. Moving forward, we aim to build a
solution that honours the resilience of our people and supports transparent, trustworthy financial
systems.
