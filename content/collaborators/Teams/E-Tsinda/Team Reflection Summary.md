 **Team Reflection Summary**

Our visit to the Twizerane saving group in Gahanga/Nunga changed many of our assumptions.
We expected to build a big app and website, but after seeing how the group works with
notebooks and simple phones, we realized they need a much simpler system. We also learned
that any solution must help them automate their operations and support future government
compliance.

---

**What shifted in our perspective:**
	● USSD must be the main tool because most members use basic phones.
	● A smartphone app is only needed for leaders with advanced tasks.
	● The main problem is not “lack of technology” but manual errors, slow calculations, and record disagreements.
	● Groups will need digital records for government requirements, which paper books cannot provide.

**What surprised or moved us:**
	● The group’s strong discipline and teamwork during meetings.
	● How much responsibility the secretary carries with manual calculations.
	● Their honesty about mistakes and how they affect trust.
	● Their openness and excitement for a simple digital system.

**What the community is asking for:**
	● A simple tool that reduces mistakes and protects records.
	● Automation for interest, contributions, and loan tracking.
	● A system that helps them meet government compliance in the future.
	● USSD for everyone, and a small app for leaders only.
	● Better transparency to keep trust strong.

**Conclusion:** The community wants simplicity, automation, and compliance support, not a complex digital
platform. The visit helped us understand that real solutions must fit their daily reality.
