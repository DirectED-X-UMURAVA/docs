## **Introduction**
This Community Essence Map captures what our team observed during our visit to the Twizerane saving group in Gahanga/Nunga. Through walking the community, attending their weekly meeting, and speaking directly with group members and leaders, we collected real stories, behaviours, and challenges that shape their daily financial life.

## **Observations From the Community Visit**
During our visit, we observed how the saving group organizes itself every Friday at 2 PM. Members sit together in a circle, bringing their personal notebooks, while leaders use a larger ledger book to manage official records. The environment is open, cooperative, and built on trust

Key observations included: 
	● Members record their savings and loan details in small pocket notebooks. 
	● The secretary keeps a main ledger book and manually calculates interest and loans. 
	● Most members own basic phones, while a few leaders have smartphones. 
	● The process depends on accuracy, memory, and repetition.

## **Key Stories & Quotes From the Community**
From our conversations and interviews, several powerful statements stood out:
	● “We keep our data in books… when someone takes a loan, they pay interest every month.” — Group President 
	● “Mistakes happen. The secretary can make errors when recording.” — Member 
	● “We prefer USSD because everyone can use it.” — Both respondents 
	● “We have smartphones and can use simple things like WhatsApp.” — Group Leader 
	● “Yes, we are willing to try a digital system if we get training.” — Members

## **Patterns, Tensions & Themes Identified**
### **A. A Strong but Fragile Trust System**
Although the group trusts each other deeply, their paper-based system is vulnerable to errors, damage, and mismatches.

### **B. Heavy Manual Workload**
Leaders spend significant time verifying records, calculating interest, and managing the main ledger.

### **C. Compliance Gap**
The group has no digital reporting system, making future compliance with government requirements difficult.

### **D. Technology Readiness**
Members prefer USSD because it works on all phones, while leaders are ready to use a smartphone app

### **E. Opportunity for Digital Support**
A USSD-first system supported by a leader’s app can: 
	● Automate calculations 
	● Reduce errors 
	● Protect against data loss 
	● Improve transparency 
	● Prepare digital records for future compliance
