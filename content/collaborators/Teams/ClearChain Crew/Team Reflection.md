At the beginning of our exploration, we assumed that renting issues were mostly about money and
communication. However, after engaging with 28 people across Kigali city, our perspective
changed significantly. We discovered that the core problem is deeper, a broken trust system where
both landlords and tenants feel unprotected.

What surprised us most was how both sides shared similar fears. Tenants feared losing deposits or
entering unsafe housing, while landlords feared damage, unpaid rent, and dishonesty. This mutual
anxiety revealed how much emotional weight the renting process carries. We also expected
technology to be welcomed, but many people shared that digital tools are either too limited or too
easy to manipulate.

We were moved by the stories of people who faced hardship simply because agreements were
informal and rely on trust. families who paid deposit for an unfinished house. The landlord who
found an empty house with damage and unpaid periods. The tenant who lived without water and
other basic need must be included in house for months. These conversations taught us that the
community is not asking for something complex - they are asking for fairness, transparency, and
neutral protection.

Through this process, we realized our role is not to replace human relationships, but to support
them with systems that reduce stress, mismanagement and conflict. The community appears to be
asking for a technology that can hold rent safely, prevent manipulation, and document agreements
clearly.
